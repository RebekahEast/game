 <h3>planning</h3>
 <p>I chose this project as I have been OBSESSED with the game for a while, and somehow still cannot win!! I wanted to create the game, and challenge my javascript skills. I knew this would be a lot of breaking the problem down into smaller sections and then building from there.<p>
<p>my first step was to understand the game and the rules. Although I played many times, when I sat down and thought about the rules of the game I couldn't recall them from memory. After finding out the 'traditional' rules, I decided to alter them just slightly (maybe I'll have a better chance at winning down! hehe!). I won't have the number 1 in my game, and I also will start with only the number 2, instead of 1 and 2 or 2 and 4. <p>
 <p>my second step was to break this big problem down and use pseudocode to think about what each action actually does. At this point, I actually went and watched a few YouTube tutorials, and looked at Scratch projects, to see how people completed the whole project and what sort of breakdown they were doing for this. </p>
 <p>My third step in the planning phase was to define the terminology of all parts of the game before I started. This helped me when building to keep track of what I was referring to back when I first started writing the code.</p>
 
 <h3>building</h3>
 <p>After all the planning, I got to work on building the user interface, and what I wanted the details on the page to show. I started building this in HTML and CSS. The header originally had an info button, a refresh button (to restart if needed), and the score tracker. These were created using a flexbox. The grid is also flexbox.
 <p>When I started creating the project, after messing around with some Javascript and spiking certain parts of it, I quickly realised I would need some 'play' areas. I added to the nav bar, a test area and created different test scenarios with predictable outcomes on each page, so I could test how to run the maneuverability, and other parts. This greatly helped me compile smaller parts of the project together</p>
 
 <h3>debugging</h3>
 <p>Debugging was of course a necessary part of this project. Javascript isn't my strongest language, so I needed to debug a lot and consider what was happening. </p>
 <p>I used breakpoints in the developer tools, to see exactly what part was going wrong, and also running a little bit of javascript within the watch line - this was useful when first trying to get my head around the array.</p>
 <p> I also had the opportunity to ask on the FAC Discord chat about Javascript timers, and attend in person meet ups at the FAC center to learn more about what I could do different</p>
 
 <h3>To Finish</h3>
 <p>This was a very big project, and at first sight I thought actually no this is too big for me. But breaking it down into smaller sections and stopping myself to think "how can I do just this bit?" and working up from there.
