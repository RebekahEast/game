            This game is great - you're going to love it! It's an easy game to pick up, but a harder game to master<br><br>
            You will need to merge any matching numbers together. When they are matched, the tiles will combine and duplicate.<br><br>
            Use the arrows on your keyboard to move the tiles back and forth, up and down (they will all move together, which makes it a little harder). Once you get a 1024 tile, you've won the game - good luck!<br><br>
            TOP TIP: it can be quite a good idea to aim for one corner of the square and keep all the high numbers in one location. That way they're more likely to end up together and merge naturally. Once you've got a corner, usually only using two directions exclusively will keep large numbers in the same place.
